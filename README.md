A-Head of WebGL
Nick Rodriguez
My senior project is a web application that uses an HTML 5 canvas, JavaScript, and the WebGL API to implement a 3D interactive environment for viewing objects or models. The app has the functionality to load a model or object into the 3D scene from a file. The user can manipulate the model view with intuitive controls for rotation and zoom. Dr. Marietta E. Cameron and her undergraduate research team provided test data for the app. The data are 3D models of human heads stored in the standard obj format which the app displays. I used Git and GitHub for version control.

Also contains completed tutorials using different WebGL libraries.The final application is found in the "final" folder. 

Drop models in the "model" folder. Organize using the same subfolder and .obj name and add to the model selector in the final/index.html file to make it pickable.
